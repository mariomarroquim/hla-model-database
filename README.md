# HLA Model Database

This is a database of HLA protein models generated via ESMFold (https://esmatlas.com). Updated with IPD-IMGT/HLA, release 3.54 (2023-10).

## Instructions

Current HLA models are in the `output` folder. Of the 21,132 HLA sequences available at the latest IPD-IMGT/HLA release, 11,040 had the expected length (regarding a reference mature HLA protein of the same locus) and were used to generate the models. To generate models for a new IPD-IMGT/HLA release, run `ruby run.rb`.
