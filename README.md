# HLA Model Database

Database of HLA protein models generated via ESMFold (https://esmatlas.com). Updated with IPD-IMGT/HLA, release 3.54 (2023-10).

## Instructions

Current HLA models are in the `output` folder. Of the 21,132 HLA sequences available at the latest IPD-IMGT/HLA release, 11,040 had the expected length (regarding a reference mature HLA protein of the same locus) and were used to generate the HLA models. To generate new models for a new IPD-IMGT/HLA release, run the `ruby run.rb` command.
